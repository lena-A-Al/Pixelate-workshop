# Pixelate 

## Instructions

An editor for your 8-bit art!

To get started:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

This will start a small http server, which will serve up the index.html file, as well as any "static resources" (that is, CSS and JS files, as well as fonts) that the index.html requests (via `link` and `script` tags). You can view the page by opening `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser!

You can add your own CSS to `style.css`, and JavaScript to `script.js`! For further instruction, refer to the workshop. Have fun!

## A Note on These Instructions

If you are in a program that has not yet used `npm` or `node` for a workshop yet, opening `index.html` in your VSCode editor (or editor of your choice) and simply working on the files should work perfectly well.
